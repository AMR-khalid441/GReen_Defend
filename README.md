- Developing an API for Plant Disease classification model
To use a TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) model in an Android application, you can follow these general steps:

Create or Obtain a TFLite Model: You can use pre-built models or convert your own TensorFlow models to TFLite format using the TensorFlow Lite Converter.
Set Up the Android Project: Create a new Android project in Android Studio and add the necessary TensorFlow Lite dependencies to your build.gradle file.
Add the TFLite Model to Your Project: Place the .tflite model file in the assets folder of your Android project.
Use TensorFlow Lite Interpreter: In your Android app code, use the TensorFlow Lite Interpreter API to load the model and run inferences.
Handle Input and Output: Transform the input data into tensors that the model can understand, and process the output tensors to use the results in your app.
